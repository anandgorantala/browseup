Browseup is a template for an 'Upgrade your browser' message page

It has png fix applied and has qTip for pretty tooltips, just cause this is an upgrade message doesn't mean it can't be fancy :)

Tested to work in IE 6, 7, 8. It displays perfectly in the other browsers too, if you need to show the message for some other browser versions
